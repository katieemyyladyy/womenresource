		<h3> 
			<p>Per NYC Open Data: “The NYC Women's Resource Network is a free, user-friendly database of over 1,000 nonprofit organizations and governmental agencies that work to advance and benefit women and families in New York City. A user can tailor their search by keyword, category, and/or borough to receive a customized listing of organizations that address their needs.”</p>

			<p>With a population of around 8.5 million people in New York City, women are more represented than their male counterparts. Throughout the five boroughs, there are about 400,000 more women than men. Having so many women in one space requires a large amount of women-centered resources. However, the way that these resources are distributed throughout the city are often inequitable. In places like Midtown, Manhattan, there could be upwards of 75 women-centered non-profits. If you take a train to the edges of Brooklyn or the Bronx, on the other hand, you may only find a couple, if any.</p>

			<p><h4>To learn more about this divergence around the city, you can click on the colored regions to see which neighborhood it is and how many women-centered nonprofits are present. Within those areas, you can also click on the black markers for the individual names of the organizations.</h4></p>
